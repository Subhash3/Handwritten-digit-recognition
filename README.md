# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Feed Forward Neural Networks.


- This project utilises a neural network library, _`nicenet`_.
- Check out its implementation from scratch [here](https://github.com/Subhash3/Neural_Net_Using_NumPy). For the pip3 package info, [click here](https://pypi.org/project/nicenet)
