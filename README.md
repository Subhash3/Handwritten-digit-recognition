# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Feed Forward Neural Networks.


- The repo uses a neural networks library, _`nicenet`_ which was created by [me](https://github.com/Subhash3).
- If you want to check out its implementation from scratch, head over [here](https://github.com/Subhash3/Neural_Net_Using_NumPy), for the pip3 package info, [click here](https://pypi.org/project/nicenet)


### Files in this repo
